        question: 'How does insurance work?',
        answer: 'When you purchase insurance, you pay premiums to an insurance company, which pools your premiums with those of other policyholders. If a covered loss occurs, the insurance company uses the pooled funds to pay for the losses of the affected policyholders.',
